# Change Log

All notable changes to the Pony compiler and standard library will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) and [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [unreleased] - unreleased

### Added

- FreeBSD 10.1 support, thanks to Ben Laurie.
- Primitive `_init` and `_final` for C library initialisation and shutdown.
- collections.Flags

### Changed

- Separated the FFI '&' operator from the identityof operator.
- Operators on Set and Map are now persistent.

### Fixed

- ANSI stripping on zero length writes to stdout/stderr.
- More OSX 10.8 compatibility.

## [0.1.5] - 2015-05-15

### Fixed

- OSX 10.8 compatibility.

## [0.1.4] - 2015-05-14

### Changed

- When using a package without a package identifier (eg. `use "foo"` as opposed to `use f = "foo"`), a `Main` type in the package will not be imported. This allows all packages to include unit tests that are run from their included `Main` actor without causing name conflicts.
- The `for` sugar now wraps the `next()` call in a try expression that does a `continue` if an error is raised.

### Added

- ANSI terminal handling on all platforms, including Windows.
- The lexer now allows underscore characters in numeric literals. This allows long numeric literals to be broken up for human readability.
- "Did you mean?" support when the compiler doesn't recognise a name but something similar is in scope.
- Garbage collection and cycle detection parameters can now be set from the command line. 
- Added a FileStream wrapper to the file package.

### Fixed

- Check whether parameters to behaviours, actor constructors and isolated constructors are sendable after flattening, to allow sendable type parameters to be used as parameters.
- Eliminate spurious "control expression" errors when another compile error has occurred.
- Handle circular package dependencies.
- Fixed ponyc options issue related to named long options with no arguments
- Cycle detector view_t structures are now reference counted.

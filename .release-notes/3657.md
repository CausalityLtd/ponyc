## Restrict Array.chop to be used with sendable element types

Previously, the `chop` method on arrays could be used for any element type,
and return two isolated halves. While this is fine for sendable data,
`ref` elements could have shared references between elements which could
violate this isolation and make the method unsound. This change now
requires that the argument is sendable to call the method.

This is a breaking change. Because the array itself is isolated,
a usage that is genuinely sound can likely be fixed by ensuring
that the element type is `iso` instead of `ref` or `trn`, or `val`
instead of `box`, and recovering when elements are constructed.

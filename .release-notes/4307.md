## Enable building of libponyc-standalone on Windows

We now ship a "standalone" version of libponyc for Windows. libponyc-standalone allows applications to use Pony compiler functionality as a library. The standalone version contains "all dependencies" needed in a single library. This library doesn't contain C or C++ runtime libs, as those get linked into every Pony program during compilation on Windows.

An example pony program linking against it on Windows would need to look like this:

```pony
use "lib:ponyc-standalone" if posix or osx or windows
use "lib:c++" if osx

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    None
```

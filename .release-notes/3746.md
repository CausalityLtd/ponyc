## Improve error messages when matching on struct types

A struct type doesn't have a type descriptor, which means that they cannot be used in match or "as" statements. Before this change, the compiler would incorrectly warn that matching against a struct wasn't possible due to a violation of capabilities, which was confusing. With this release, the compiler will now show a more helpful error message, explicitly mentioning that struct types can't be used in union types.

As an example, the following piece of Pony code:

```pony
struct Rect

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    let a: (Rect | None) = None
    match a
    | let a': Rect => None
    | None => None
    end
```

would fail to compile on ponyc 0.40.0 with the following error message:

```
Error:
main.pony:7:7: this capture violates capabilities, because the match would need to differentiate by capability at runtime instead of matching on type alone
    | let a': Rect => None
      ^
    Info:
    main.pony:5:18: the match type allows for more than one possibility with the same type as pattern type, but different capabilities. match type: (Rect ref | None val)
        let a: (Rect | None) = None
                     ^
    main.pony:7:7: pattern type: Rect ref
        | let a': Rect => None
          ^
    main.pony:7:15: matching (Rect ref | None val) with Rect ref could violate capabilities
        | let a': Rect => None
                  ^
```

Starting with this release, the error message is:

```
Error:
main.pony:7:7: this capture cannot match, since the type Rect ref is a struct and lacks a type descriptor
    | let a': Rect => None
      ^
    Info:
    main.pony:5:18: a struct cannot be part of a union type. match type: (Rect ref | None val)
        let a: (Rect | None) = None
                     ^
    main.pony:7:7: pattern type: Rect ref
        | let a': Rect => None
          ^
    main.pony:7:15: matching (Rect ref | None val) with Rect ref is not possible, since a struct lacks a type descriptor
        | let a': Rect => None
                  ^
```

## Fix compiler crash related to using private types as default arguments

The compiler crash described in #4130 happened with code that attempted to call a method in a different package when this remote method used a package-private type as a default parameter.

```pony
// In the "lib" pacakge

primitive _Private

primitive Public
  fun apply[T](v: (T | _Private) = _Private): None => None

// In main
use lib = "lib"

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    let p = lib.Public.apply[U8]()
    env.out.print(p.string())
```

It was decided that this code is valid Pony code, and this PR fixes the crash so that code like the above compiles.

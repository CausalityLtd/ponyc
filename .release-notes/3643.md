## Fix unsound checks for return subtyping

Changed the subtyping model used in the compiler,
fixing some unsound cases that were allowed for function returns.
This also will result in changed error messages, with more
instances of unaliasing instead of aliasing. The tutorial has
been updated with these changes.

This is a breaking change, as some code which used to be accepted
by the typechecker is now rejected. This could include sound code
which was not technically type-safe, as well as unsound code.

This code used to be erroneously allowed and is now rejected
(it would allow a val and an iso to alias):
```
class Foo
  let x: Bar iso = Bar
  fun get_bad(): Bar val =>
    x
```

In addition, the standard library Map class now has a weaker
type signature as it could not implement its current type signature.
The `upsert` and `insert_if_absent` methods now return T! instead of T

## Fix for infinite Ranges

Even though all Range objects that contain NaN parameters are considered infinite, some did not iterate at all or produced an error after the first iteration. For example, the code from the Range documentation: 

```pony
  // this Range will produce 0 at first, then infinitely NaN
  let nan: F64 = F64(0) / F64(0)
  for what_am_i in Range[F64](0, 1000, nan) do
    wild_guess(what_am_i)
  end 
```

did not run as expected, but rather produced an error on the first iteration. This is now fixed, and .next() calls on the above `Range[F64](0, 1000, nan)` now first yields 0 and subsequently indefinetely NaN values.

## Change the return type of String.add to String iso^ (RFC 69)

This release introduces a breaking change by changing the return type of `String.add` from `String val` to `String iso^`.

Where you previously had code like:

```pony
let c = Circle
let str = "Radius: " + c.get_radius().string() + "\n"
env.out.print(str)
```

you now need:

```pony
let c = Circle
let str = recover val "Radius: " + c.get_radius().string() + "\n" end
env.out.print(str)
```

or you can also let the compiler do the work for you by using explicit type declarations:

```pony
let c = Circle
let str: String = "Radius: " + c.get_radius().string() + "\n"
env.out.print(str)
```

The above code works since `val` is the default reference capability of the `String` type.

The new type makes it simpler to implement the `Stringable` interface by using `String.add`. Where before you had code like:

```pony
class MyClass is Stringable
  let var1: String = "hello"
  let var2: String = " world"

  fun string(): String iso^ =>
    recover
      String.create(var1.size() + var1.size())
        .>append(var1)
        .>append(var2)
    end
```

you can now implement the `string` method as such:

```pony
class MyClass is Stringable
  let var1: String = "hello"
  let var2: String = " world"

  fun string(): String iso^ =>
    var1 + var2
```

## Adapt docgen to only depend the mkdocs material theme

We used to have our own mkdocs theme for ponylang documentation, it was based off of the mkdocs-material theme. This change puts the adaptationswe need into the mkdocs.yml file itself, so we don't depend on our own theme anymore, but only on the upstream mkdocs-material.

This is a **Breaking Change** in so far that users that want to generate documentation with ponyc now have to install the python package `mkdocs-material` instead of `mkdocs-ponylang` to generate their documentation in HTML form with mkdocs. The [library documentation github action](https://github.com/ponylang/library-documentation-action) will have the correct dependencies installed, so no changes should be needed when using it.

This PR also makes docgen work again on windows, which was not able to write the documentation files, due to path handling issues on windows.

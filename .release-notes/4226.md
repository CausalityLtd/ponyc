## Adapt docgen to only depend the mkdocs material theme

We used to have our own mkdocs theme for ponylang documentation,
it was based off of the mkdocs-material theme. This change puts the adaptations
we need into the mkdocs.yaml file itself, so we don't depend on our own theme anymore,
but only on the upstream mkdocs-material.

## Fix API mismatch errors when linking pony programs on MacOS

We have been setting a minimal API version for ponyc that didn't match the LLVM value. This resulted in errors about how the link versions didn't match. The warnings caused no issues running programs, but did lead to confusion amongst new users. They were also annoying to look at all the time.

We did some testing and determined that there's no need to set the value as we can build ponyc and other pony programs on Big Sur and still use on earlier versions of MacOS.

There might be some issues that crop up in the future, but as far as we can tell, for normal ponyc MacOS usage, we dont need to set `macosx-version-min`.

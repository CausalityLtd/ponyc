# Fix a major bug which allowed mutating fields of a val object

A bug was introduced in 0.51.2 which caused some checks to allow mutating fields of a val object due to changes to some operations on capabilities. This bug is fixed: immutability is now checked separately from other properties.

If you are using Pony 0.51.2 to 0.52.3, you should upgrade to the 0.52.4 release that contains this fix as soon as possible.

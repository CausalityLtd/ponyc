## Make Range.next partial

Range.next used to return the final index over and over when you reached the end. It was decided that this was a confusing and error prone API.

Range.next is now partial and will return error when you try to iterate past the end of the range.

Where you previously had code like:

```pony
let r = Range(0,5)
let a = r.next()
```

you now need (or similar based on your usage of Range.next

```pony
try
  let r = Range(0,5)
  let a = r.next()?
end
```

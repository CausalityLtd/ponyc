## Enable building of libponyc-standalone on MacOS

We now ship a "standalone" version of libponyc for MacOS. libponyc-standalone allows applications to use Pony compiler functionality as a library. The standalone version contains "all dependencies" needed in a single library. On MacOS, sadly "all dependencies" means "all that can be statically linked", so unlike Linux, dynamically linking to C++ standard library is required on MacOS.

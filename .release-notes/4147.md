## Change error message

Previously when assigning to a field of a field in box functions you recieved "not safe to write right side to left side"

The error message when assigning to a field of a field in box functions was fixed to reflect that the function should be a fun ref. This affects code like the below:

```pony
class TestClass
  var x: ISize

actor Main
  let my_test_class: TestClass = TestClass
        
   new create(env: Env) =>
      None 
                
    fun test() =>
      my_test_class.x = 1
```

This was changed  to "cannot write to a field in a box function. If you are trying to change state in a function use fun ref." to improve understanding of the error.

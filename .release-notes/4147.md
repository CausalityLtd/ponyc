## Change error message

The error message when assigning to a field of a field in box functions was fixed to reflect that the function should be a fun ref. This affects code like the below:

```pony
actor Main
        let my_test_class: TestClass= TestClass
        new create(env: Env) =>
                """placeholder"""
        fun test() =>
                my_test_class.x= 1
```

was changed from "not safe to write right side to left side" to "cannot write to a field in a box function. If you are trying to change state in a function use fun ref."

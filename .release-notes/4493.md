## Add constrained types package to standard library

We've added a new package to the standard library: `constrained_types`.

The `constrained_types` package allows you to represent in the type system, domain rules like "Username must be 6 to 12 characters in length and only container lower case ASCII letters".

To learn more about the package, checkout its [documentation on the standard library docs site](https://stdlib.ponylang.io/constrained_types--index/).

You can learn more about the motivation behind the package by reading [the RFC](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/main/text/0079-constrained-types.md).

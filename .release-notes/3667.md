## Fix race conditions that can lead to a segfault

The [0.38.0](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.38.0) release introduced improvement to handling of short-lived actors. However, in the process it also introduced some race condition situations that could lead to segfaults. [0.38.1](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.38.1) introduced a fix that we hoped would address the problems, however, after that release we realized that it didn't fully address the situation. With this change, we've reworked the implementation of the short-lived actor improvements to avoid the trigger for the known race conditions entirely.

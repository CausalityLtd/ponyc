## Fix generation of invalid LLVM IR

Previously, this code failed at LLVM module verification. Now, with this change, it's fixed by stopping the generation of `ret` instructions after terminator instructions:

```pony
class Foo
  new create(a: U32) ? =>
    error

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    try
      let f = Foo(1)?
    end
```

## FreeBSD is no longer a supported platform

We no longer have access to hardware that we can test FreeBSD on as part of our regular Continous Integration and Release cycles. As such, we are removing FreeBSD as a supported platform. We will make best effort attempts to not break FreeBSD, however, it is likely to fall behind and need maintenance from interested community members.

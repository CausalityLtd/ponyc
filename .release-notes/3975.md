## Remove library mode option from ponyc

From the very early days of the Pony runtime, a "library mode" has been around that allows you to compile a Pony program to a C compatible library that you can then start up using various runtime APIs to do things like initialize the runtime, create actors, send messages and more. We've made extensive changes to the runtime over the years and have no faith that library mode and its related functionality work.

Our lack of faith extends back many years and we've stated as the Pony core team that we don't consider library mode to be supported; until now, we haven't done anything about what "not supported" means.

With this release, library mode has been removed as an option.

## Fixed Windows TCP faulty connection error

Fixed a bug where a `TCPConnection` could connect to a socket that wasn't listening.

## Fixed zombie Windows TCP connection error

Fixed a bug where socket events were sometimes never unsubscribed to which would lead to "zombie" connections that were open but couldn't receive data.

## Fixed "oversleeping" on Windows

Previously, we were calling `Sleep` rather than `SleepEx` when putting scheduler threads to sleep. This could have caused Windows IO events to be missed.

## Fix compiler crash from `match` with extra parens around `let` in tuple

When matching on a tuple element within a union type, the compiler would crash when extra parentheses were present.

The following code fails to compile because of `(123, (let x: I32))` in the `match`. The extra parentheses should be ignored and treated like `(123, let x: I32)`.

```pony
let value: (I32 | (I32, I32)) = (123, 42)

match value
| (123, (let x: I32)) => x
end
```

## Fix actor heap chunk size tracking bug that could cause a segfault

The [0.55.1](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.55.1) release included some internal actor heap implementation optimizations. Unfortunately, there was a small bug that could potentially cause a segfault due to not properly clearing some bits before setting them for some heap chunks. This change corrects that oversight to ensure the relevant bits are properly cleared before being set to ensure they final result can never be incorrect.

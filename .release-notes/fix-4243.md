## Fix "Don't include 'home file' in documentation search"

[PR #4243](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/4243) incorrectly implemented the "don't include 'home file' in documentation search". It has been fixed.

The original release notes are now accurate (before it wasn't working!):

We've updated the documentation generation to not include the "home file" that lists the packages in the search index. The "exclude from search engine" functionality is only available in the `mkdocs-material-insiders` theme.

The home file is extra noise in the index that provides no value. For anyone using the insiders theme, this will be an improvement in the search experience.

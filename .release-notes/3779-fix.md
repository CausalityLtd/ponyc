## Don't allow PONYPATH to override standard library

Prior to this change, a library could contain a package called `builtin` that would override to standard library version. This could be an attack vector. You can still override the standard library location by using the ponyc `--paths` option.

Any code which relied on the PONYPATH items being before the standard library in the package search path will need to switch to using `--paths` on the ponyc command line.

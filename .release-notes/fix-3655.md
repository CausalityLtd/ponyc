## Fix compiler crash related to using tuples as a generic constraint

Tuple types aren't legal constraints on generics in Pony and we have a check in an early compiler pass to detect and report that error. However, it was previously possible to "sneak" a tuple type as a generic constraint past the earlier check in the compiler by "smuggling" it in a type alias.

The type aliases aren't flattened into their various components until after the code that disallows tuples as generic constraints which would result in the following code causing ponyc to assert:

```ponyc
type Blocksize is (U8, U32)
class Block[T: Blocksize]
```

We've added an additional check to the compiler in a later pass to report an error on the "smuggled" tuple type as a constraint.

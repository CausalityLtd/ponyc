## Fix OOM error when running ponyc built with xcode 12.5

Changes in Big Sur and xcode as of 12.5 have lead to an out of memory error with ponyc. If pony's allocator is built with usage of VM_FLAGS_SUPERPAGE_SIZE_ANY on, it will run out of memory if xcode 12.5 was used to build.

VM_FLAGS_SUPERPAGE_SIZE_ANY isn't required on earlier versions. It does however, improve performance when allocating. Usage of VM_FLAGS_SUPERPAGE_SIZE_ANY has been removed as it also doesn't work on newer M1 based machines and thus, is on its way out in general.

## Fix literal inference with partial functions

Before this change, code such as `1~add(2)` would hit an assertion error when the compiler tried to infer the type of the literal `2`. The compiler tries to find the type of the receiver of the function (in this case `1`), but before it lacked the ability to do so when using partial functions. In those cases, the compiler would try to look at the type of the `~` token, which is not a valid value literal, and as such it would fail.

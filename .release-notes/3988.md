## Expose additional scheduler information in the runtime_info package

Three additional methods have been added to `SchedulerInfo`.

- minimum_schedulers

Returns the minimum number of schedulers that will be active.

- scaling_is_active

Returns if scheduler scaling is on

- will_yield_cpu

Returns if scheduler threads are yielding the CPU to other processes when they have no work to do.

## Fix segfaults with debug builds on 64-bit Arm

Debug builds on 64-bit Arm platforms were segfaulting. The code generated when doing `ponyc --debug` wouldn't work and would eventually crash. We believe the source to be an LLVM bug but, aren't certain.

We've introduced a work around that fixes the segfault problem, but does some optimization of debug builds for 64-bit Arm platforms. Additional investigation is underway. You can track progress by [following issue #3874](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3874).

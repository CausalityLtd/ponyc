## Fix runtime segfault

A segfault was introduced in ["Fix segfault caused by unsafe garbage collection optimization"](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/4256). `tag` objects were being incorrectly traced which could eventually result in a segfault.

If you are using Pony version 0.52.3 to 0.52.5, we recommend upgrading as soon as possible.

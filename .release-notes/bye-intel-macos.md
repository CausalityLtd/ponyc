## Deprecate macOS on Intel support

We have moved macOS on Intel from being a fully supported platform to a best effort platform. We are no longer providing prebuilt ponyc binaries for macOS on Intel. We also no longer do any CI testing using macOS on Intel. We are not planning on intentionally breaking macOS on Intel but supporting it is no longer a priority.

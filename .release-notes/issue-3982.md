## Stop creating prebuilt ponyc releases for Ubuntu 21.04

Ubuntu 21.04 hit its end-of-life at the end of January 2022. We are no longer build prebuilt ponyc releases for it. If you are still using Ubuntu 21.04 and need ponyc for 21.04, you'll have to build from source.

The next Ubuntu LTS release is coming in April of 2022 and we'll be adding prebuilt ponyc for it. If have upgraded to a non-LTS Ubuntu after 21.04 that s still supported and would like us to do ponyc releases for it, please let us know via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues) or via [the Ponylang Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/).

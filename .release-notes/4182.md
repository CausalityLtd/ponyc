## Enhance checking for identity comparison with new objects

Consider the following program:

```pony
class C

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    env.out.print(if C is C then "C is C" else "C is NOT C" end)
```

This will fail to compile with the message `identity comparison with a new object will always be false`.

Nevertheless, the checking wasn't exhaustive and some cases weren't covered, like the one in the following example:

```pony
class C

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    env.out.print(if C.create() is C.create() then "C is C" else "C is NOT C" end)
```

We've made the check exhaustive and we believe it now covers all possible cases.

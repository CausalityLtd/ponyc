## Allow constructor expressions to be auto-recovered in assignments or arguments

Previously for the following code:

```pony
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    Bar.take_foo(Foo(88))
    let bar: Foo iso = Foo(88)

class Foo
  new create(v: U8) =>
    None

primitive Bar
  fun take_foo(foo: Foo iso) =>
    None
```

You'd get compilation errors `argument not assignable to parameter` and `right side must be a subtype of left side` for the two lines in `Main.create()`.

We've added checks to see if the constructor expressions can be implicitly auto-recovered, and if they can, no compilation error is generated.

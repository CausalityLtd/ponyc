## Fix esoteric bug with serializing bare lambdas

Almost no one uses bare lambdas. And even fewer folks end up passing them through the Pony serialization code. So, of course, Red Davies did just that. And of course, he found a bug.

When we switched to LLVM 15 in 0.54.1, we had to account for a rather large change with how LLVM handles pointer and types. In the process of doing that update, a mistake was made and serializing of bare lambdas was broken.

We've made the fix and introduced a regression test. Enjoy your fix Red!

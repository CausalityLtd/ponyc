## Drop Fedora 39 support

Fedora 39 has reached its end of life date. We've dropped it as a supported platform. That means, we no longer create prebuilt binaries for installation via `ponyup` for Fedora 39.

We will maintain best effort to keep Fedora 39 continuing to work for anyone who wants to use it and builds `ponyc` from source.

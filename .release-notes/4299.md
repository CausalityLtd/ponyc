## Remove ambiguity from "not safe to write" compiler error message

Previously, when displaying the "not safe to write" error message, the information provided was incomplete in a way that lead to ambiguity. A "not safe to write" error involves two components, the left side type being assigned to and the right side type being assigned to the left side. We were only displaying the right side, not the left side type, thus making it somewhat difficult to know exactly what the error was.
As an example, when trying to write to a field in an iso class instance, we get:

```
Error:
/Users/jairocaro-accinoviciana/issues-pony-4290/demo.pony:10:11: not safe to write right side to left side
    x.foo = foo
          ^
    Info:
    /Users/jairocaro-accinoviciana/issues-pony-4290/demo.pony:9:14: right side type: Foo ref
        let foo: Foo ref = Foo
                 ^
```


With this change, the error becomes:

```
Error:
/Users/jairocaro-accinoviciana/issues-pony-4290/demo.pony:10:11: not safe to write right side to left side
    x.foo = foo
          ^
    Info:
    /Users/jairocaro-accinoviciana/issues-pony-4290/demo.pony:9:14: right side type: Foo ref
        let foo: Foo ref = Foo
                 ^
    /Users/jairocaro-accinoviciana/issues-pony-4290/demo.pony:10:5: left side type: X iso
        x.foo = foo
        ^
```

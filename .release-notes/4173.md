## Fix for segfault when using Array.copy_to() with an empty Array

Previously, `Array.copy_to()` did not check whether the source Array had been initialized. Uninitialized arrays internally have a null pointer for their data as no memory has been allocated for them yet. When doing a copy like in the example below, this would result in an attempt to dereference the null pointer and a segfault.

```pony
class Foo
    embed _array: Array[I32] = []

new create() => None
new clone(src: Foo) => src._array.copy_to(_array, 0, 0, 10)

actor Main

    new create(env': Env) =>
        let f2 = Foo.clone(Foo)
```

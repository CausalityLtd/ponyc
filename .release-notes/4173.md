## Fix for segfault when using Array.copy_to() with an empty Array

Currently, the `Array.copy_to()` function does not check whether the Array is empty or has been instanced with any values. This leads to a runtime crash when calling `copy_to()` on an empty array such as in this example (issue #4172):

```pony
class Foo
    embed _array: Array[I32] = []

new create() => None
new clone(src: Foo) => src._array.copy_to(_array, 0, 0, 10)

actor Main

    new create(env': Env) =>
        let f2 = Foo.clone(Foo)
```

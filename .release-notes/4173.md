## Fix for segfault when using Array.copy_to() with an empty Array

Previously, `Array.copy_to()` did not check whether the source Array had been initialized. Uninitialized arrays internally have a null pointer for their data as no memory has been allocated for them yet. When doing a copy like in the example below, this would result in an attempt to dereference the null pointer and a segfault.

```pony
class Foo
  embed _array: Array[I32] = []

  new create() => 
    None

  new clone(src: Foo) =>
    src._array.copy_to(_array, 0, 0, 10)

actor Main
  new create(env': Env) =>
  let foo1 = Foo
  let foo2 = Foo.clone(foo1)
```

`Array` is part of the `builtin` package of the standard library. Only code in `builtin` is allowed to do direct pointer manipulations like those that `Array` uses to implement `copy_to`. Direct pointer manipulations, if done incorrectly, can lead to segfaults and other memory related errors. Because pointer manipulation can be dangerous, only code in the `builtin` package is allowed to do it. 

We consider unsafe pointer operations in the `builtin` package to be of utmost importance and once this bug was found moved quickly to release a fix.

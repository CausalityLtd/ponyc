## Fix for potential memory corruption in Array.copy_to()

`Array.copy_to()` did not check whether the source or destination Arrays had been initialized or whether the requested number of elements to be copied exceeded the number of available elements (allocated memory). These issues would result in potential dereferencing of a null pointer or attempts to access unallocated memory.

```pony
class Foo
  embed _array: Array[I32] = []

  new create() => 
    None

  new clone(src: Foo) =>
    src._array.copy_to(_array, 0, 0, 10)

actor Main
  new create(env': Env) =>
  let foo1 = Foo
  let foo2 = Foo.clone(foo1)
```

`Array` is part of the `builtin` package of the standard library. Only code in `builtin` is allowed to do direct pointer manipulations like those that `Array` uses to implement `copy_to`. Direct pointer manipulations, if done incorrectly, can lead to segfaults and other memory related errors.

We consider unsafe pointer operations in the `builtin` package to be of utmost importance and once this bug was found moved quickly to release a fix.

## Fix symbol table patching for default implementations that replaces another method

This release fixes a compiler crash that could happen when a default
implementation replaced another method with the same signature. An example of
this is when intersecting two interfaces that both have a method with the same
signature and the second interface provides a default implementation:

```pony
interface A
  fun f(): U32

interface B
  fun f(): U32 =>
    let x: U32 = 42
    x

interface C is (A & B)
```

In this case, the default implementation was copied to `C`, but without its
symbol table, subsequently resulting in a compiler crash.

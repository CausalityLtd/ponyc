## Graceful error handling on `consume` expressions

The fix ensures 
* `consume (consume variable).field` results in a graceful compilation error
* `consume f().field` results in similar compilation error as `consume f()`
* Allow `(consume obj).field` expressions
  The following snippet 
  ```pony
	 (consume f).b =  recover Bar end
  ```
  must be equivalent to
  
  ```pony
     let x = consume f
	 x.b = recover Bar end
 ```

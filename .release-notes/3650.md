## Handling compiler crashes in some `consume` expressions

Previously  an expression of the form `consume (consume variable).field` resulted in the compiler crashing down with an assertion failure. With this fix, we get a friendly error message pointing to the erroneous line.

Likewise, a valid assignment of the form `(consume f).b =  recover Bar end` resulted in a compiler crash. With the fix, the compiler successfuly type checks the assignment and ensures that `f` is _consumed_.

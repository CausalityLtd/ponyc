## Fix building ponyc on DragonFly BSD

DragonFly BSD is lightly used as a supposed platform. It is also "unsupported" due to lack of CI. Over time, ponyc fell out of being able to be built on DragonFly. 

As of this release, you should be able to use ponyc on DragonFly again. However, do to the unsupported nature of the DragonFly port, it might break again in which case, updates from anyone using Pony on DragonFly will be needed.

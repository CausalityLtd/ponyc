## Fix for potential memory corruption in `Array.copy_to`

`Array.copy_to` did not check whether the source or destination Arrays had been initialized or whether the requested number of elements to be copied exceeded the number of available elements (allocated memory). These issues would result in potential dereferencing of a null pointer or attempts to access unallocated memory.

Before this fix, the following code would print `11` then `0`:

```pony
actor Main
  new create(e: Env) =>
    var src: Array[U8] = [1]
    var dest: Array[U8] = [11; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]

    try
      e.out.print(dest(0)?.string())
    end
    src.copy_to(dest, 11, 0, 10)

    try
      e.out.print(dest(0)?.string())
    end
```

After the fix, this code correctly prints `11` and `11`.

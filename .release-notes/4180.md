## Fix unwanted indentation in `StdStream.print`

When printing via `StdStream.print` strings containing the null terminator, the
standard library was printing the string until the null terminator and then
padding the printed string with space characters until the string size was
reached.

That behavior was introduced in release 0.12.0, fixing a left-over from when
Pony strings were null terminated.

Now the `print` function is effectively printing every character in the string
plus an ending newline character.

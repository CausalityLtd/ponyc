## Fix unwanted indentation in `StdStream.print`

When printing via `StdStream.print` strings containing null bytes, the standard library was printing the string until the first null byte and then padding the printed string with space characters until the string size was reached.

This bug was introduced in Pony 0.12.0 while fixing a different printing bug.

Now  `Stdstream.print` is effectively printing every character in the string plus an ending newline character.

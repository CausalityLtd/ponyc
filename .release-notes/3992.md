## `itertools` additions

Previously there were methods for `Iter` within `itertools` which, while originally planned, where not implemented. These methods have now been implemented.

Added methods include:

+ `dedup` which removes local duplicates from consecutive identical elements via a provided hash function
+ `interleave` which alternates values between two iterators until both run out
+ `interleave_shortest` which alternates values between two iterators until one of them runs out
+ `intersperse` which yields a given value after every `n` elements of the iterator
+ `step_by` which yields every `n`th element of the iterator
+ `unique` which removes global duplicates of identical elements via a provided hash function

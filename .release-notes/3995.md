## Revert "prevent non-opaque structs from being used as behaviour parameters"

The bug that [#3781](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3781) aka "prevent non-opaque structs from being used as behaviour parameters" was an attempt at preventing, as only partially solved by the change.

We've introduced a full fix in [#3993](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3993) that removes the need for [#3871](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3781).

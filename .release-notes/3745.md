## Update to LLVM 12.0.1

We've updated the LLVM used to build pony to LLVM 12.0.1 and in the process, we've dropped support for 32-bit ARM as supported platform.

We might bring 32-bit Arm back as a supported platform if the Arm fixes we need to do to get ponyc working on M1 also fix the current issues we have with 32-bit Arm with LLVM 12. The errors currently present the same so we assume that adding M1 support will bring 32-bit ARM along with it. If fixing the M1 issues doesn't fix 32-bit Arm issues then we'll have to make a decision about whether we bring back 32-bit Arm support.

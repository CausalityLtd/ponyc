## Fix function calls in consume expressions

Function calls are not allowed in `consume` expressions. However, if the expression being `consume`d is a field access expression, whose LHS happens to be a function call,
the compiler fails after hitting an assertion.

For instance the following results in a compilation failure

```pony
    let a = "I am a string"
    let x:C iso! = consume a.chop(1)
```

but the following results in a compiler crash with an assertion failure

```pony
    let a = "I am a string"
    let x:C iso! = consume a.chop(1)._1
```

The fix ensures that both the scenarios are handled gracefully.

## Fix compiler crash related to explicit FFI return types

After we re-added the ability to override the return type for FFI function calls in a [previous release](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.50.0), we forgot to reintroduce some checks in the compiler that ensured that the specified return types would be known to the code generation pass. This caused some programs that introduced a new type (for example, a bare lambda) in the context of a FFI return type to crash the compiler. This is now fixed.

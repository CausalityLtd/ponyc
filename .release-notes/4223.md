## Fix incorrect interaction between String/Array reserve and Pointer realloc

This was an interesting one. So, there's was an interesting interaction between String and Array's reserve and Pointer's realloc. Generally, it went like this:

`reserve` when it called `realloc` would give `realloc` a single value, the size of the newly reserved chunk of memory. This would result in `realloc` copying not just the in-use items from old memory to newly allocated memory, but in fact, the entire old memory chunk.

This could lead to very surprising results if `reserve` had been called by `undefined`. And in general, it could lead to suboptimal performance as we could end up copying more than was needed.

`realloc` has been updated to take to parameters, now, the amount of memory to alloc and the number of bytes to copy from old memory to new.

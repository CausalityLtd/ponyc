## Support void* (Pointer[None]) parameters in bare lambdas and functions

Unlike conventional FFI functions, bare lambdas `@{(...)}` and bare functions `fun @bare() => ...` did not support `Pointer[None]` parameters, Pony's equivalent of `void*`. This is despite the fact that like FFI functions, bare lambdas and functions are strictly intended for use with FFI calls and callbacks.

This commit allows bare lambdas and bare functions with `Pointer[None]` parameters to accept arguments of any `Pointer[A]` type for these parameters. Therefore, code like the following now works:

```pony
use @printf[I32](fmt: Pointer[None] tag, ...)

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    let printer = @{(fmt: Pointer[None] tag): I32 => @printf(fmt)}
    let cb = this~print()
    printer("Hello".cstring())
    cb(" world!\n".cstring())

  fun @print(fmt: Pointer[None]): I32 =>
    @printf(fmt)
```

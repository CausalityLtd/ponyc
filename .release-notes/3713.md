## Fix FFI declarations ignoring partial annotation

Previously, the compiler would ignore any `?` annotations on FFI declarations, which could result in the generated code lacking any guards for errors, causing the final program to abort at runtime. This change fixes the problem by ensuring that the compiler checks if FFI declarations specify a partial annotation.

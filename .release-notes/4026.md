## Fix the interfaces for Iter's `map` and `map_stateful` methods to be less strict

The `map_stateful` and `map` methods on an Iter (from the itertools package) were too strict in what they required, requiring a `B^` in order to produce an `Iter[B]`.

This change correctly makes them only require `B`.

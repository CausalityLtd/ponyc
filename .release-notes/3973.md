## Don't allow interfaces to have private methods

When Pony allowed interfaces to have private methods, it was possible to use an interface to break encapsulation for objects and access private methods from outside their enclosing package.

The following code used to be legal Pony code but will now fail with a compiler error:

```pony
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    let x: String ref = "sailor".string()
    let y: Foo = x
    y._set(0, 'f')
    env.out.print("Hello, " + x)

interface Foo
  fun ref _set(i: USize, value: U8): U8
```

If you were previously using interfaces with private methods in your code, you'll need to switch them to being traits and then use nominal typing on all the implementers.

For example:

```pony
interface Foo
  fun ref _bar()
```

would become:

```pony
trait Foo
  fun ref _bar()
```

And any objects that need to provide `Foo` would be changed from:

```pony
class ProvidesFoo
```

to

```pony
class ProvidesFoo is Foo
```

We believe that the only impact of this change will primarily be a single interface in the standard library `AsioEventNotify` and updates that need to be done to deal with it changing from an interface to a trait.

If you are unable to make the changes above, it means that you were taking the encapsulation violation bug we've fixed and will need to rethink your design. If you need assistance with such a redesign, please stop by the [Pony Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/) and we'll do what we can to help.

## Change `builtin/AsioEventNotify` from an interface to a trait

The "Don't allow interfaces to have private methods" change that is part of this release required that we change the `AsioEventNotify` interface to a trait.
If you are one of the few users outside of the standard library to be using the ASIO subsystem directly in your Pony code, you'll need to make an update to
conform to this change.

Where previously you had something like:

```pony
class AsioEventReceivingClass
  be _event_notify(event: AsioEventID, flags: U32, arg: U32) =>
    ...
```

You'll need to switch to using nominal typing rather than structural:

```pony
class AsioEventReceivingClass is AsioEventNotify
  be _event_notify(event: AsioEventID, flags: U32, arg: U32) =>
    ...
```

As far as we know, there are two codebases that will be impacted by this change:

## Prevent non-opaque structs from being used as behaviour parameters

When a non-opaque object is sent across actors, its type descriptor is used by the garbage collector in order to trace it. Since structs lack a type descriptor, using a `val` or `iso` struct as a parameter behaviour could lead to a runtime segfault. This also applies to tuple parameters where at least one element is a non-opaque struct.

This is a breaking change. Existing code will need to wrap struct parameters in classes or structs, or use structs with a `tag` capability. Where you previously had code like:

```pony
struct Foo

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    inspect(recover Foo end)

  be inspect(f: Foo iso) =>
    // Do something with f
```

you will now need

```pony
struct Foo

class Bar
  let f: Foo = Foo

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    inspect(recover Bar end)

  be inspect(wrap: Bar iso) =>
    // Do something with wrap.f
```

When using tuples with struct elements, you don't need to wrap the entire tuple. It is enough to wrap the struct elements.

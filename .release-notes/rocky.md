## Add prebuilt ponyc binaries for Rocky Linux 8

Prebuilt nightly versions of ponyc are now available from our [Cloudsmith nightlies repo](https://cloudsmith.io/~ponylang/repos/nightlies/packages/). Release versions will be available in the [release repo](https://cloudsmith.io/~ponylang/repos/releases/packages/) starting with this release.

CentOS 8 releases were added as we currently support CentOS 8, but it will be discontinued in a few months and Rocky Linux provides a seamless transition path.

If you are a Pony user and are looking for prebuilt releases for your distribution, open an issue and let us know. We'll do our best to add support for any Linux distribution version that is still supported by their creators.

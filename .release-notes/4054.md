## Fixed parameter names not being checked

In 2018, when we [removed case functions](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2542) from Pony, we also removed the checking to make sure that parameters names were valid.

We've added checking of parameter names to make sure they match the naming rules for parameters in Pony.

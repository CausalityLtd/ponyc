## Fix unhandled null pointer that can lead to a segfault

Previously, the `os_socket_listen` and `os_socket_connect` internal functions would assume that calls to `os_addrinfo_intern` would never fail. The `os_addrinfo_intern` function returns a null pointer on failure, which could result in the callers attempting to free an invalid pointer, and causing a segfault. This change adds error handling on the socket functions, which fixes the problem.

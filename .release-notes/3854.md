## Fix erratic cycle detector triggering on some Arm systems

Triggering of cycle detector runs was based on an assumption that our "tick" time source would monotonically increase. That is, that the values seen by getting a tick would always increase in value.

This assumption is true as long as we have a hardware source of ticks to use. However, on some Arm systems, the hardware cycle counter isn't available to user code. On these these, we fall back to use `clock_gettime` as a source of ticks. When `clock_gettime` is the source of ticks, the ticks are no longer monotonically increasing.

Usage of the cycle detector with the non-monotonically increasing tick sources would cause the cycle detector run very infrequently and somewhat erratically. This was most likely to be seen on hardware like the Raspberry Pi.

## Change docgen theme to MkDocs Material
    
We have changed how documentation generation is handled, and we are deprecating the `ponylang` theme for the official upstream `material` theme.

If you are building documentation for your library from the latest release of ponyc, make sure that you change your configuration to install the correct package now:

```diff
-pip install mkdocs-ponylang
+pip install mkdocs-material
```

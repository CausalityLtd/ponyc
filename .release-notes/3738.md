## Add IsPrime to math package

Quickly determine if a given number is prime using the 6k ± 1 method.

All prime numbers (excluding 2 and 3), can be expressed as (6k + i), where i = −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since 2 divides (6k + 0), (6k + 2), and (6k + 4), while 3 divides (6k + 3) that leaves only (6k - 1) and (6k + 1).
